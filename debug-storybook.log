[00:29:22.083] [INFO] Upgrading from [1m8.6.14[22m to [1m10.2.11[22m
[00:29:22.085] [ERROR] Blockers detected

Storybook has found potential blockers that need to be resolved before upgrading:

[33mMajor Version Gap Detected[39m

Your Storybook version (v8.6.14) is more than one major version behind the target release (v10.2.11). Please upgrade one major version at a time.

You can upgrade to version 9 by running:
[36mnpx storybook@9 upgrade[39m

Affected projects: /packages/react/.storybook

More information: https://storybook.js.org/docs/9/migration-guide?ref=upgrade

---

After addressing this, you can try running the upgrade command again. You can also rerun the upgrade command with the [36m--force[39m flag to skip the blocker check and to proceed with the upgrade.
